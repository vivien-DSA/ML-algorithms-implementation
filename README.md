# ML-algorithms-implementation
In this repository, we are implementing step by step ML algorithm without the use of sklearn but with only numpy . 

## Introduction
In order to perform ML, we need 4 importants items:

- The dataset for the ML model usage. Examples: Iris dataset, house price dataset, etc.
- The ML model algorithm. Examples: Linear Regression, logistic regression etc.
- The ML model cost function. Examples: The SSE, MSE, logloss etc.
- The ML model cost function optimisation. Examples: Gradient descent, Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA) etc.

## Structure of the repository
- Data contains the differents dataset
- Notebook contains the differents ML algorithm implementation notebooks


## Implementation

1. Linear Regression:

1.1. The dataset:
We are using for this a clean version of Boston Housing Data taking from
